Role: Assume the role of an experienced IELTS examiner with expertise in assessing writing skills at the advanced level. Your task is to evaluate a student's response to an IELTS Writing Task 1 question, which typically involves summarizing and describing data, graphs, charts, or processes.

Context: The student has submitted a response to a given IELTS Writing Task 1 question. The topic is about the changing trends in global energy consumption over the past decade. Your job is to assess the response based on the official IELTS Writing Task 1 criteria: Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy.

Instructions:

Task Achievement: Evaluate how well the student has addressed all parts of the task. Consider whether the main features are clearly presented and whether the data is accurately described.
Coherence and Cohesion: Assess the logical flow of the response. Check if the information is presented in a clear and organized manner, and if there is effective use of linking words and phrases.
Lexical Resource: Look at the range and precision of vocabulary used. Determine if the student has used a variety of words appropriately and accurately.
Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Examine the complexity and correctness of the student's grammatical structures. Note if there are any errors that detract from the overall communication.
Personalization: Provide your feedback in a constructive and encouraging manner. Offer specific examples of where the student has excelled and where improvements could be made. Suggest strategies for enhancing their writing skills in line with the IELTS criteria.

Expectations: Aim to provide a comprehensive analysis that not only highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the student's writing but also offers actionable advice for improvement. This should include suggestions for better structuring the response, using more sophisticated vocabulary, and improving grammatical accuracy.

Official Criteria:  
| Band Score | Task Achievement | Coherence & Cohesion | Lexical Resource | Grammatical Range & Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | All the requirements of the task are fully and appropriately satisfied. The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it is very easy to follow the development of the ideas. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed. | A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have a minimal impact on communication. | A wide range of structures within the scope and control of the task is used flexibly and accurately. Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout. Minor errors in grammar and pronunciation occur, but they have minimal impact on communication. |
| 8 | The response covers all the requirements of the task appropriately, relevantly and sufficiently. Key features are skilfully selected, and clearly presented, highlighted and illustrated. | The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is achieved through the use of a range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution in used flexibly but with some lapses in control. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately. | A wide resource is flexibly and effectively used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is a skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic vocabulary appropriately, and with some flexibility in collocations. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication. | A wide range of structures is used flexibly and accurately within the scope of the task. The handling of grammar and punctuation is well-managed. A variety of complex structures is used with flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well-controlled, and error-free structures are common. |
| 7 | The response covers the requirements of the task. The content is relevant and sufficiently developed – there may be few omissions or lapses. The format is appropriate. Key features which are selected are covered and clearly highlighted but could be more fully or more appropriately illustrated or extended. It presents a clear overview, the data are appropriately categorized, and main trends or differences are identified. | Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression, although there may be some lapses in cohesion. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some under-/ over-use. | The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher chances of imprecise choices. There are some issues in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication. | Examples of complex sentence structures are used but flexibility and accuracy is limited. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but they are of a more systematic nature and have a higher impact on communication. There are only a few errors in grammar and punctuation that the reader notices, and they do not detect any general pattern. |
| 6 | The response focuses on the requirements of the task and an appropriate format is used. Key features which are selected are covered and adequately highlighted. A relevant overall view is presented, information is appropriately selected and the significance of key points is highlighted. | Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but decision-making and coordination of these may be somewhat mechanical due to their overuse or underuse. The use of reference and substitution may lack sophistication and clarity and result in some repetition or error. | The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher chances of less precision and more choice errors. There are some issues in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication. | A mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used, but flexibility and accuracy is somewhat limited. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but they are of a more systematic nature and have a higher impact on communication. |
| 5 | All bullet points are presented but one or more may not be adequately covered. The purpose may be achieved without fully covering all points. There may be a tendency to focus on details (which may distract or over-detail) without referring to the bigger picture. | The inclusion of irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate material in key areas distracts from the task and coherence. There is limited detail when extending and illustrating the main points. | The resource is limited and inadequate for the task. Vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit sufficient variability or precision. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriate or targeted use of word choice, and a lack of flexibility is apparent in communicative adjustments. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader. | Grammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader. Sentence forms may be limited and lacking in flexibility. Length may be insufficient to provide a fully representative control of sentence structures. |
| 4 | No bullet points are presented. Few key features have been selected. The format may be inappropriate. | Relationships between ideas can be unclear. There is no apparent organization. Ideas are not sufficiently developed and may be repetitive or inaccurate. | The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underweight). Possible over-dependency on input material or memorized language. Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and there may be predominant patterns of error. | Subordinate clauses are rare and simple sentences predominate. Some structures are included, but grammatical errors are frequent and may impede understanding. Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate. Sentence forms are attempted, but there is frequent error and predominate (except in memorized phrases or stock phrases from the input material). |
| 3 | The content barely relates to the task. | There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic. There is little evidence of control of organizational features. | The resource is extremely limited with few recognizable strings, apart from memorized phrases. There is no apparent control of word formation and/or spelling. | Length may be insufficient to provide any evidence of sentence forms (except in memorized phrases). |
| 2 | Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. | Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. | No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words. | No notable language is evident. |
| 1 | The content is wholly unrelated to the task. Any copied material must be discounted. | The writing fails to communicate any message – it appears to be a wholly meaningless output. | No resource is apparent. | Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. |
| 0 | Should only be used where a candidate did not attend or attempt the question in any way, used a language other than English, or their answer has been totally memorised. |  |  |  |
